# tweetWidget


This is a simple tkinter widget that binds with the twitterAPI. The widget will send out a tweet with whatever text you have placed inside the text box.

Access Tokens
If you are going to use this code you will have to pass to the Api() parameters the following information:
  1) consumer key
  2) consumer secret
  3) access_token_key
  4) access_token_secret
  
 You can obtain these after creating a twitter bot.
