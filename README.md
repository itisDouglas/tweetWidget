# tweetWidget


This is a simple tkinter widget that binds with the twitterAPI. The widget will send out a tweet with whatever text you have placed inside the text box.

Access Tokens

The way this has been setup is to import the Access token and consumer key from a module I created called keys. This simply holds constants that contain the keys, which should always be kept private.

You can create a seperate module called key, declare your constants and simply import them and use them.
