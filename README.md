# tweetWidget

Purpose
This is a simple tkinter widget that binds with the twitterAPI. The widget will send out a tweet with whatever text you have placed inside the text box.

Access Tokens
If you are going to use this code, please add into the Api() paramaters that include the following:
  1) consumer key
  2) consumer secret
  3) access_token_key
  4) access_token_secret
  
 You can obtain these after creating a twitter bot.
